# maintenance_scripts
Collection of scripts done by me, which will help you optimize your Windows performance, by doing things such as removing non-essential Windows features (bloatware) or checking for malware using the built-in Windows Defender.

I highly recommend using these scripts with the Windows task manager, so you can schedule their execution as you'd like.
